close the kiosk properly, because it is still wide open.

"218","we wish that they repair this broken pipe in quarter 12 to avoid water wastage,
because it is leaking a lot.

fetching quickly and get the time of doing other home activities.

water before the time of closing.
"
"221","as we don't get water on high pressure, they should let us fetch until 11:00 am
for everyone to get water.
"
"222","wastes should be taken out of the block being sure that the truck is ready to
carry them, because leaving them out leads to poor hygiene.
"
"223","if they separate our main van from the one of water kiosk nâ°1 of quarter 2, we
will be able to get enough water in a short time.
"
"224","increase the pressure of water that are released to this water kiosk nâ°2 of
quarter 2, so that we can't spend so much time here.
"
"225","if they increase the pressure of released water, we will no longer spend so much
time here waiting for one gallon to be full.
"
"226","assess on why we are not getting enough water nowadays, so that the pressure of
water can be increased.
"
"227","releasing enough water, so that we can be get fast services.
"
"228","they should weld this iron tap on this water point in quarter 3, because the way
it was repaired didn't stop it from leaking.
"
"229","releasing much water can be helpful because we line for too long waiting to get
water because of less water release.
"
"230","provide easily birth certificates so that we can't delay to register our
children at unhcr.
"
"231","to put a roof on this garbage block can be better because there come a bad smell
due to that wastes are being mixed with rainwater.

properly closed to prevent those who enter inside to open water.

from causing bad smell around here.
"
"238","increasing the pressure of released water to help us fetch quickly in a short
time.
"
"239","for us to feel satisfied, they should regularly supply water to all kiosks
because we didn't get water today.
"
"240","the rehabilitation of this garbage block in quarter 2 can help for better
retention of wastes because they use to spread out.
"
"241","they should inform us early that they will not release water, so that we can
plan to go fetch water in other locations.
"
"242","they have to build a water channel on this new shower block in quarter 3 so that
water from it can't run towards our houses.
"
"243","building a washstand nearby here can help us have a comfortable place for
laundry because we don't have any other nearby here.
"

on this water kiosk so that water can run smoothly.
"
"245","these holes dug on shower blocks under construction need to be permanently
covered because leaving them uncovered well can cause accidents.
"
"246","they should repair this leaking water pipe in quarter 9 to avoid such water
wastage, because its been leaking for many days.
"
"247","our wish is to see them maintaining the period of fetching to enable all people
get water because we are currently fetching for fewer time.
"
"248","if removing these talbots on this water point in quarter 3 is not possible, they
should increase water pressure because they release less.
"
"249","we with that they find a durable solution to the fetching issue for us to feel
satisfied because when one kiosk is fetching, the other can't
"
"250","they should keep releasing water in the early morning in q1 for us to get water
nearby us, because they usually forget to release it.
"
"251","better if a nurse is assigned with other duties after serving waiting patients
to avoid getting late services because he/she was not around.
"
"252","we wish that they build a water channel here in order to direct water from this
water point because water from there run towards my house.
"
"253","delivering drugs at pharmacy should be quickened so that we can't wait longer to
get the prescribed drugs because today they were too slow.

because they started putting it down and stopped.
"
"255","we keep asking for a garbage block in this quarter 3 so that we can have a
nearby place where to deposit wastes as we don't have any nearby.
"
"256","better they respect 9am as the time of closing water to help everyone get water
because they use to close it earlier to the time.
"
"257","we wish to have a guider when we are referred to the district hospital for us to
get treatment on time because we use to be neglected there.
"
"258","for us to keep using these shower rooms in quarter 3, better they put a roof on
them because we can't use them during this rainy period.
"
"259","better the plumber restore harmony among fetchers on both kiosks in quarter 2
because when water is increased on one side, the other miss it
"
"260","they should replace this broken water pipe in quarter 5 in avoiding such water
wastage because it keeps leaking where they tried to repair.
"
"261","they should plan on how to retain water from shower blocks they are building in
managing it and prevent that it will runs towards our homes
"
"262","because the previous tap was demolished and removed on this water tank in
quarter 6, better another one is fixed for avoiding water wastage.
"
"263","we wish that they build a washstand around here for helping us have a
comfortable place for laundry because we don't have any to use nearby
"
"264","we keep requesting that they found cemented blocks to cover up these holes
because the packed sacs put there were demolished by the rain.
"
"265","we keep requesting that they provide padlocks to us because people keep
disturbing the van as they freely enter inside the kiosk.
"
"266","referring a patient earlier can be better because delaying makes a patient reach
into a critical condition.
"
"267","we still wishing that they put a water channel on this water kiosk 3 in quarter
5 so that the stagnant water can run smoothly, to avoid mud.
"
"268","for us to be satisfied, better they release water again so that we can all fetch
because they close it early to the time yet we didn't fetch
"
"269","we wish that they increase the pressure of the flowing water towards water point
in quarter 10 because we usually get less water flow.
"
"270","they should respect the hour of releasing water on tuesday because they use to
delay releasing water yet we have finished the community work
"
"271","starting consulting us at least at 8am can be a better way of avoiding that we
spend the whole day at health center because of a delay start
"
"272","for us to feel more satisfied with water supply, better they release more water
because currently we are getting less water flow.
"
"273","better if they remove these talbots on this water point in quarter 3 for us to
get more water flow because they do not release much water.
"
"274","providing padlocks to us can be better so that we can close the kiosk properly
because even though a door was fixed, it's still wide open.
"
"275","they should release water to all fetching sites for all of us to get water,
because we didn't get any drop this morning.
"
"276","as promised, they should build a washstand nearby here for proper laundry
because the ground for it is available which was the hindrance.
"
"277","better they replace these old sacs with blocks of cement to cover up those holes
on latrines as sacs were demolished to prevent accidents.
"
"278","we wish to see this garbage block in quarter 7 emptied because being full of
wastes makes some spread around here leading to poor hygiene.
"
"279","we keep requesting that they put down this unused old shower block because it is
a threat to us as people hide themselves there at midnight.
"
"280","a bridge here between quarter 10 and 11 can be helpful for the use of this road
because it's not easy since the previous was destroyed.
"
"281","they should respect the period of fetching because we feel annoyed when they
close it too early because it makes us leave without fetching.
"
"282","they should remove these talbots on this water point to enable us get more water
flow because they don't let us get more water like before.

"283","for us to feel more satisfied, they have to release sufficient amount of water
because we got droplets of water since they released water.
"
"284","they should repair these leaking pipes in quarter 9 to avoid such water wastage,
because they leak a lot through their joints.
"
"285","to release enough amount of water so that all people can get water because we
are currently getting less water flow on this water point.
"
"286","putting a water channel on this shower block under construction can be better
for directing the running rainwater that flows toward my house
"
"287","better they increase the pressure of supplied water because we always get less
water flow which makes many people leave without fetching.
"
"288","releasing water for the whole scheduled period of fetching for everyone to get
water, because they closed it earlier to the time.
"
"289","we always ask that they rehabilitate this garbage block to enable it retain
wastes properly because it was too demolished to retain wastes.
"
"290","the solution to the lack of water in quarter 2 can be having separate vans for
both kiosks because we are currently not getting enough water
"
"291","releasing water on the same time to all water kiosks so that all people can get
water to use because some areas got water, others not.
"
"292","in order to prevent this muddy ground we stand in while fetching, better they
build a water channel here so that water can't stay stagnant.
"
"293","we should be given a precised time for getting a transfer for us to know the
exact time because telling us to wait makes us feel neglected.
"
"294","it can be better if they regulate well the valves to avoid that water is wasted
when this water tank in quarter 3 is fully supplied.
"
"295","a garbage truck should be availed to carry wastes in this garbage block in
quarter 7 as wastes start spreading because it is fully loaded.
"
"296","better they refer me at least at the district hospital for further treatment
because staying here in ipd with no recovery makes things worse
"
"297","they should carry these wastes from here because they are causing poor around
here as they were washed away by rainwater in the road.
"
"298","if a patient has to be referred to the tertiary hospital, better the transfer is
approved as soon as possible for getting treatment on time.
"
"299","wastes should be taken out of the garbage block when the truck is ready to carry
them because the current rain fall is washing them away.
"
"300","they should find how we can get water regularly on our kiosk 2 in quarter 6
because we didn't get water yesterday and this morning.
"
"301","instead of permanently closing those shower rooms, they should put cylinders in
those doors so that we can close them after taking shower.
"
"302","they should find how we can get water regularly on this water point in quarter
12 like in other areas because we don't get water everyday
"
"303","for us to not return back home at lunch time without treatment, better they
assign more than one nurse to consult patients.
"
"304","better all wastes are carried away for better hygiene, because some are left
behind spreading all over causing poor hygiene.
"
"305","we keep requesting that they find blocks to put on these doors of this shower
block under construction so that they can't be use as toilets.

"306","we wish they can remove these talbots on this water point, because they don't
release more water compared to what we used to get before
"
"307","a kiosk volunteer should stay around to open water for us, so that we can't miss
an opener to open water because s/he is not around.
"
"308","better they prioritize weaker patients in service delivery for them to get quick
treatment because they can't resist sitting for long.
"
"309","they should put temporary shields on doors of this shower block under
construction in q2 as it is being used as toilet causing poor hygiene.
"
"310","they should build infrastructure like such shower block near our reach because
being too distant can not favor their usage.

so that we can be able to open and close while using them.
"
"312","we wish that they provide a truck to carry these wastes in this garbage block in
quarter 4 because they are causing poor hygiene around here
"
"313","they should fix a new valve on this water tank in quarter 5 because water is
wasted when its full as we are unable to close it.

"314","they have to maintain the scheduled period of fetching because they have closed
water too early making many people leave without fetching.

"315","if there is any other activity taking place, better the serving nurse explain to
waiting patients in order to wait being aware of the reason
"
"316","if its yet to finalize building these shower blocks, better they put there
temporary blockages on doors to avoid poor hygiene inside them.
"
"317","they should tell us before that the laboratory results will be available in
afternoon for us to not keep waiting them.
"
"318","because we are required to climb over the tank to get water, better they fix a
new valve on the tank so that we can easily open water.

close the kiosk as it is still wide open to everyone.

can have a comfortable place for laundry.
